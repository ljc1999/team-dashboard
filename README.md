###Live Version: https://5c027233dd28ef7e562fc7c2--stoic-johnson-cb29cf.netlify.com/

### UPDATES

Updated to Angular 6 and added MDBootstrap.


### VERY UNFINISHED!!!

Should probably add the couchDB code back in and maybe write some tests, meh.
It could look nicer but I only spent about 10 minutes copying the old layouts.


### But seriously...

It works


## "The Dev Stuff"

    npm install
    ng serve

    (You may need to install the angular cli if you haven't already: npm install -g @angular/cli)
